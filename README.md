Preprocessor directives in C# are instructions given to the compiler to preprocess the source code before actual compilation. They are used to conditionally compile code, include or exclude sections of code, and define symbols for conditional compilation.

Here are some common preprocessor directives in C#:

1. **#define**: Used to define a symbol.
   ```csharp
   #define DEBUG
   ```

2. **#if, #elif, #else, #endif**: Used for conditional compilation.
   ```csharp
   #if DEBUG
       // Debug-specific code
   #elif RELEASE
       // Release-specific code
   #else
       // Code for other configurations
   #endif
   ```

3. **#warning**: Generates a warning message during compilation.
   ```csharp
   #warning This code needs optimization
   ```

4. **#error**: Generates an error message during compilation.
   ```csharp
   #if DEBUG
       #error Debug mode is not allowed in production
   #endif
   ```

5. **#undef**: Undefines a symbol.
   ```csharp
   #undef DEBUG
   ```

6. **#region, #endregion**: Defines a collapsible region in the code editor (not technically a preprocessor directive, but often used for organizing code).
   ```csharp
   #region Initialization
       // Code related to initialization
   #endregion
   ```

These directives help in creating versatile and configurable codebases, especially when targeting different build configurations or managing platform-specific code.
